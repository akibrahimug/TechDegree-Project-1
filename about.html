            <p>IGC fashion was formed in December of 2015, since then we have been creating, sharing, and inspiring the world with our bespoke
                <br>costumes and wearable designs, we pride ourselves in using second hand fabrics, natural materials like barkcloth and working with different local artisans 
                <br>in the creation of our clothes.</p>
                <p>The picture you see below is a project we are currentily working on <q>The Mistaken Fabrics</q> a project that addresses the issues of unsustainable comsumption
                <br>of clothes and the impact it has on our enviroment.</p>

                <h2>Our Fabrics and why we use them</h2>
             <p>IGC fashion is an advocate of the fashion sustainable fashion practises and we have a saying that says, buy what you need and not what you want and mending clothes is not a sign of poverty but shows that you understand the impacts of what the clothes you discard have on the impact.

             <p>The othe reason why we use second hand barics is because of the too many second hand clothes that are imported into the country which has made local textile and fabric industiries to go out of business, this has left</p>
             <p>the Uganda Fashion sector with no alternative but to use chiness fabrics which are either too expensive or thie enviromental impact is greater than giving secon hand fabrics a new life, this is because they are produced in very unstainable ways and these companies are not transparent about it</p>
             <p>We also use barkcloth(lubugo) which is a natural fabric got from the bark of the fig tree, this tree is regenerative and it takes 6months to grow and bark from the time of harvest.
            <p>Barkcloth is also a traditional cloth that has been used in the East African reagion since the 15th century, and we feel this is a good way of preserving our culture by using it and advocating for it use and reseacrh since its a very 
            <br>sustainable fabric</p>
