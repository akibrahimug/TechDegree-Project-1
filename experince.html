          <h2>My Experience</h2>
          <p>I am a self taught fashion designer who started a community based organisation in the surbubs of Kampala, 
            <br>Uganda called IGC fashion, the reason behind this was to provide free tailoring skills to the youth,
            <br> women and single mothers of finacially strugling communities.
            <br>I knew that if they had the skills they could be able to provide for their families.</p> 
          <p>Later IGC fashion grew into an established Fashion Label because we couldnt afford to provide the free education since the whole programme was self funded and the grants never came.
              It has been five years since we started the CBO and IGC fashion can facilitate studio space, meet client needs, pay staff and we still run the free skills workshops setting up a percentage of the sales we make.</p>
          <p> In my fashion Journey, all tasks involved have been greatily related to problem solving and self improvement through self learning, this process has made me more intune to the process of self mastery, eye for detail, client and community engagement.</p>
          <p>Before i started my career as a fashion designer, i was a peer educator, volunteer co-ordinator and vocal advocater for basic human rights for a Non Govermental organisation in Uganda called Uganda Youth and Women's Efforts to Fight AIDS(Uywefa)</p>
          <p>I greatly believe that these experiences paired together can make me a valuable asset for a web developer role.</p>
